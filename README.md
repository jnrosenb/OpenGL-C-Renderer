# OpenGL-C-Renderer
Simple renderer using OpenGL and C++

Right now it consists on:

- Materials (Textured with lambert for diffuse and phong for specular, textured with PBR, Unlit, Skybox).
- Support for one or multiple lights.
- In the process of introducing shadows (for now, it can hold only one shadow).
- In the process of introducing global illumination (reflection).
- Skybox.
- No mesh loading yet (works with torus, plane, sphere and cube primitives).
- Simple controls (move camera with wasd, move look with mouse drag).
